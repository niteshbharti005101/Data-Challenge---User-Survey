**1. Understand and visualize the survey result (hint: You may use excel, pandas any other libraries)**

**2. What are the most important concerns(hint: principal components) which stop users to participate in social good activities.**

**Application of NULL Hypothesis in order to check which parameter in the survey is the key factor in stopping users to participate in social good activities**
